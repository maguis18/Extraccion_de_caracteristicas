We love the lifestyle of living close to our families who are in different states and then renting our houses to people that need short term rentals.  We set our houses up with our guests in mind which simplifies and streamlines our living as well. We have met absolutely wonderful people along this 10 year journey and love the lifestyle. We enjoy hiking, biking, kayaking, fishing, watercolor and most of all hanging out with family.
